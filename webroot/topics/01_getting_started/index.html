<h1>Getting started</h1>

<h2>Welcome</h2>

<ul>

<li>Foundation is a responsive frontend framework</li>
<li>It is CSS (and SASS), JavaScript and HTML</li>
<li>Developed with an eye on UX best practice and web standards accessibility</li>
<li>Has offical templates, building blocks and foundation kits (bundles of building blocks) which you may use to speed up your development</li>
<li>It built with SASS which is "CSS with superpowers" and compiles to plain CSS but can be written using variables, mixins and nesting to save typing and arrange better</li>
<li>Used to be a framework for sites, apps and emails. But this is now streamlined to sites and emails frameworks (with some apps framework stuff going into sites and apps framework being generally available as a playgound experiment)</li>

</ul>


<h2>Installation</h2>

<ul>

<li>Can install with a package manager (npm, bower, composer etc) which is good if you need or want the SASS source</li>
<li>Can git clone the official github repo (but this method not mentioned on 6.4 docs?)</li>
<li>Download (full, lightweight or custom options) - good if you don't need or want the SASS</li>
<li>CDN</li>
<li>"Foundation CLI" which is an npm meta installer / meta package</li>

</ul>



<h2>Starter projects</h2>


<ul>
<li>Foundation CLI can install some different project templates</li>
<li>Basic template and ZURB template</li>
<li>Both templates use "Gulp" build system (to automate Sass compilation, JavaScript processing and etc)</li>
</ul>
